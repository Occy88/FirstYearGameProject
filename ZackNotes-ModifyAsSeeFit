##

Modify as see fit i may have missed something and
	my ideas may be crap

###

Start

Initiate http connection(s)

Iniyiate game variables & set up

Game Loop {
	
	Camera Stuff

	Handle user input

	Update objects
		Handle Collisions
		Move Objects

	Draw objects

	Remove necisary objects
	
}

###

Mob Levels {

	Maybe defined by differculty rather than size:
		the classic armoured carrage that when destroyed
		spawn low level mobs

	Current mob level definitions

	Lv1 = Goblins... [smaller/same ish to player]
	Lv6 = Boss... [Massive 1x1 grass square]
}

Game {
	
	Explore to get loot
		Upgrade base & selves

	Further from base = more differcult mobs = better loot

	Could do:
		Base in field
		Surounded by easy forest
		Surrounded by zones, eg north = fire, south = ice
		Surrounded by mountains
			should theme mountains
				volcano in fire
				really snowy in ice

	Example Zones...
		Volcanic
			Fire based mobs
			VERY damaging lavalakes
			random Lavay rocks fall from sky with little warning
				More frequent/bigger when gets harder
		Frozen
			Ice based mobs
			Blizard that pushes mobs, maybe lil dmg
			Frozen lakes -> reduced slowing down and movement
				Effect icy mobs less?
		Forrest
			Trees, normalish forest mobs
			Stuff hiding in trees/discuised as trees
		Desert
			Sandy Mobs
			Tunneling Mobs, eg sand shark or massive tunneling work at
				bursts from ground
			Sand storm pushes players & reduces visibility/move speed
		...

	Could still do waves, but with much larger gaps between
		eg timer in corner so know when to come back for wave

		If doing above then wave differculty will ramp up much
		harder than defined bellow
}

Mob Waves [just Waves] {

	??? Performance wise, may need to vier towards more differcult
	??? induvidual mobs rather than quantity

	Simple Pattern:
		4 Waves of mob LVn and below
		1 Wave boss of LV(n+1) also with LVn and below
		n +=1
		repeat

	More Complex:
		When introduce new mobs of varying level experiment with how
		it can be used, eg Lower level swarm behing a big tanky mob
		until something is within a range of the big mob

		Swarm from multiple directions on the map
			will have to split up due to relativly slow walking speed

		LV2 or LV3 mobs same stats as LV1's but really fast
}

Combat {
	
	For now dont impliment knockback or anything

	Collisions -> Circles are by far the most efficient
					shapes

	Damage {

		creatures can have doDamage method or something
		
		instead or more health, better armour reduce
		damage taken by a percentage specifiv to armour

		Penalty for bigger armour, eg...
			Heavy: reduced ranged & magic rate & dmg
				   reduce speed?
			Light: reduce magic range & dmg
			None: None
	}

	Bow {
		Simple - person that fired check for collision
			ever game loop

			on collision call foDamage method or something

			can do finite arrows
				mobs that have been shot drop arrows shot
				into them when killed

				missed arrows can be picked up
	}

	Melee {
		Do not have circle sector object, can just do circle
		centred on player when attacking

	}

	Magic {
		##be aware the last fantasy game i played was skyrim

		Acts very much like a mob in and of itself
			Different characteristics based on spell
			eg 	Fire bolt = 1 enimy then vanish
				Fire storm = constantlt atk all
					monsters in range

		Can do other effects like slow:
			slow
				depending on server restraints and how timestanps
				work out

			fire/poison
				dmg over time

		Runes (landmine spells)
	}
}
